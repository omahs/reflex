# form-designer

This is the Form Designer sample app for Reflex.

It demonstrates how to make dynamic forms, take responses from end users, and display
responses to the owner of the form.

## Usage

To get started, login to the app. If you have not already registered, then register a new
account with username and password.

The first user created on an instance will automatically be the admin user and has access
to view and edit forms created by all other users.

### Create a Form

Click "Create or Edit Forms" to enter the form designer.

Either select an existing form from the drop down, or create a new form by
entering a name in the "Form Name" box. Press enter, or wait a second for the
form to be created.

When a form is selected, the interface will show the current fields associated
with the form. Click the prompt of an existing field to edit it. Click the "X"
button to delete the field.

Below the existing fields, click "Add Field" to add a new field to the form.

The Edit Field dialog allows you to enter a name for the field and a longer
prompt with instructions for how to answer the field. You can also select the
type of field, and add or remove options for enumerated types, like select,
radio, or checkbox.

### Fill out a Form

Click the "Preview" button next to the form name box to see the form as an end
user would see it.

You can share the link to this preview to allow other users to answer the form.

### View Responses

Click the "Responses" button next to the form name box to see all responses that
have been collected. Responses can be removed by clicking the red "X" button.
